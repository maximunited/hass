## When power is detected, and the washing machine is not in
## the Running state, change the status of the washing machine
## to Running.
## The status check will ensure we don't try to put the state
## to Running each time the power level changes, and we're already
## in the Running state. 
#
# Washing Cycles:
# Off == 0 W
# Button on == 1 W
# Working high cycle == 2150 W
# Working regular cycle > 250 W
# Post cycle/Anti-Crease/Finish < 35 W
